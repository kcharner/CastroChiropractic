							        <p>This is a widely used type of chiropractic manipulation/adjustment that includes most of the procedures taught in chiropractic institutions. This technique is the most commonly used of all chiropractic techniques and is the one probably most familiar to patients. The Diversified manipulation/adjustment entails a high velocity, low-amplitude thrust delivered by hand and possibly with assistance from a table or block. This usually results in a cavitation of a joint (quick, shallow thrusts that cause the popping noise often associated with a chiropractic manipulation/adjustment). As the name implies, the Diversified Technique can be used to treat many of the joints in the body and is the primary technique used by the doctor in the office.</p>

							      <div class="modal-body">
							        <p>ART is a patented, state of the art soft tissue system/movement based massage technique that treats problems with muscles, tendons, ligaments, fascia and nerves. Headaches, back pain, carpal tunnel syndrome, shin splints, shoulder pain, sciatica, plantar fasciitis, knee problems, and tennis elbow are just a few of the many conditions that can be resolved quickly and permanently with ART. What separates ART treatment from conventional massage or muscle work, is the precise directed tension and the very specific movement to ensure the smooth movement of tissue, the directed breaking up of scar tissue and the ability restore function with minimal treatment time. These conditions all have one important thing in common: they are often a result of overused muscles.</p>
							        <p>How do overuse conditions occur? Over-used muscles (and other soft tissues) change in three important ways:</br>
							        	<ul>
							        		<li>acute conditions (pulls, tears, collisions, etc)</li>
							        		<li>accumulation of small tears (micro-trauma)</li>
							        		<li>not getting enough oxygen (hypoxia)</li>
							        	</ul>
							        </p>
							        <p>Each of these factors can cause your body to produce tough, dense scar tissue in the affected area. This scar tissue binds up and ties down tissues that need to move freely. As scar tissue builds up, muscles become shorter and weaker, tension on tendons causes tendonitis, and nerves can become trapped. This can cause reduced range of motion, loss of strength, and pain. If a nerve is trapped you may also feel tingling, numbness, and weakness.</p>

							        <p>Disc decompression therapy (decompression traction) is an alternative, conservative, noninvasive, nonsurgical procedure of applying axial traction to the spine. It can be used in the treatment of several conditions, including low back or neck pain associated with lumbar disc bulges or herniations, degenerative disc disease, posterior facet syndrome, failed back syndrome, spinal stenosis and radiculopathy (sciatica).</p>
							        <p>The clinical objectives of this therapy include relief of disabling low back pain, neck, arm or leg pain by reducing the pressure placed on spinal nerves, allowing the healing process to begin.</p>

							      </div>
							      <div class="modal-body">
							        <p>TENS machines works by sending stimulating pulses across the surface of the skin and along the nerve strands.</p>
							        <p>The stimulating pulses help prevent pain signals from reaching the brain.Tens devices also help stimulate your body to produce higher levels of its own natural painkillers, called "endorphins".</p>
									<p>E.M.S. stands for (Electrical Muscle Stimulation) which are predominately used to prevent, or reduce, muscle atrophy. Atrophy is the weakening and loss of muscle tone, which is usually experienced after surgeries or injuries. EMS has been proven to be an effective means of preventing muscle atrophy. EMS also helps by increasing blood flow to muscles, increasing range of motion, increasing muscle strength, as well as enhancing muscle endurance. EMS has pain management attributes in helping muscle related pain, such as a spastic muscle, sore muscles, or tight muscles.</p>
									<p>Both methods have been proven to be an effective pain therapy option to help ease the effects of acute or chronic pain.</p>

							      </div>
							      <div class="modal-body">
							        <p>Horizontal Therapy is much like an electrical stimulation machine or a TENS unit. It acts very specifically and within certain electrical parameters to influence the target tissue at a cellular level. This type of therapy tends to carry the possibility of long lasting benefits. It is aimed to bring about an analgesic pain relieving affect by calming down nerve pain without piercing through the skin. This is done by placing specific surface electrodes on the skin and introducing specific signal impulses to block nerve pain as well as reducing muscle spasm.</p>
							        <p>What Types of Conditions Are Treated with Horizontal Therapy?</p>
							        <p>Conditions such as low back pain, neck pain, fibromyalgia, myofascial pain syndrome, overuse injuries, muscle re-education, headaches, post -operative pain, muscle spasm, nerve pain, joint swelling, inflammation, Spinal Stenosis, Frozen Shoulder, Sciatica, Carpal Tunnel, Neuralgia, Depression...and many other conditions can be effectively treated with the Horizontal Therapy.</p>
